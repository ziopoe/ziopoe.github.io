## Something about me

I started coding in year 2000, published my first website in 2004 and studied deeply html and css, after all of that I changed life and now I'm voluntarily stuck with this plain website.

Today is 2022 - 03 - 19 and I'm leaving my home again for 4 to 5 months, I wanted to have some kind of blog to document my future but I'm running out of time.

Here is a picture of me taken at nigh with my 2017 phone reflected in a giant chromed steel ball.
