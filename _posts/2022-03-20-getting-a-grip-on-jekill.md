### I'm getting to a good starting point

I'm getting a grip on how Jekill works, there is no more time to make changes but I will study it in the coming months when time permits.

The funny thing is that I changed as little as possible of the basic version of github.

It's clearly not a presentable site but no one will see it anyway, it's all an exercise for me to see if it's worth investing time in and if I'll actually use it.
